# Outline

???

OK, so, here's what we're going to talk about today. Prospective ageing in a few sepcially selected countries. I wonder how they were selected?

So, briefly, here's what is going to happen. I will of course start by talking about what exactly do we mean when we say population ageing ;) I am sorry about that. I know this is the institute of population ageing...

Then I will explain the concept of prospective age as opposed to chronological age. And we'll have a think abotu why it might be useful

And finally we will bring it home: by which I mean that we'll have a look at how population ageing measured using prospective age measures looks like in your country of origin. Hopefully making it more interesting for all of you. And just in case that isn't interesting enough there will be animations as well, so

* What is population ageing?

* What is *prospective age*?

* Bring it home

# Measuring Ageing
???
On the individual level we usually speak of ageing chronologically, you grow one year older every year. Of course there are other ways of looking at age here, how old you look or how old you feel, but those are subjective, and let's stick with objective, demographic measures. 

On the Populaiton level there are a few standard measures that are commonly used: these are the proportion of the population in old age, the old age dependency ratio and the median age. 

One thing to note is that individual level ageing only goes one way, but population level ageing can go both ways: a population can grow younger. 

**But more importantly: all of these measures use chronological age. **

--

* Individual level:

--

    + Age
--

    + ...
--

* Population level:

--

    + proportion of the population in old age
--

    + old-age dependency ratio et al.
--

    + median age

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

So, what is wrong with using *chronological age* to measure ageing?

???
It assumes that a 60 year old person in 1800 is just as old as a 60-year old person in 2000, just because they have lived the same number of years. But have they aged at the same rate? 
Well, in 1800 only 25% of men survived to the age of 60, while today that number is over 90 %. So clearly the answer is no, the two 60 year-olds are not the same at all. One is middle aged and one is elderly. 


So I think Sanderson and Scherbov - who are the main proponents of using prospective age - put it really nicely here: 

And what else has grown apart from our interest in population ageing? **Life expectancy**. 

At this point I will skip the standard thing that everyone does when they present here, so I won't actually talk directly about the increases in life expectancy and assume you know it's pretty much going up just about everyhwere. 

But this is the point: chronological age does not take into account changes in life excpectancy.

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

???
So let's have a look at how taking life expectancy into account works in practice compared to retrospective age. 

---

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(0,1.5,0,0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0,100),
     ylim = c(0,7), type = "n", 
     axes = FALSE, bty = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

text(-5, 5.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,5, 40, 6, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 5.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,5, 84.7, 6, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 5.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")

```

???
1. We start in 1952, with a french woman born in 1922, which means that in 1952 she is 30 years old. In that year the priod life expectancy for a 30 year old was 44.7. 


---

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(0,1.5,0,0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0,100),
     ylim = c(0,7), type = "n", 
     axes = FALSE, bty = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

text(-5, 5.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,5, 40, 6, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 5.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,5, 84.7, 6, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 5.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
text(-5, 4.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,4, 40, 5, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 4.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,4, 94.4, 5, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 4.5, "remaining life expectancy: 54.4")

```

???
2. Now let's take another 30-year old woman, this time in 2005. She has also survived 30 years and her life expectancy is 54.4 years.

So both women are 30 years old. 

---

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(0,1.5,0,0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0,100),
     ylim = c(0,7), type = "n", 
     axes = FALSE, bty = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

text(-5, 5.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,5, 40, 6, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 5.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,5, 84.7, 6, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 5.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
text(-5, 4.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,4, 40, 5, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 4.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,4, 94.4, 5, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 4.5, "remaining life expectancy: 54.4")

arrows(10, 3.8, 40, 3.8, length = .15, lwd = 3, col = "red")
```

???
By which we mean that both women have a retrospective age of 30 years. 

But are they really the same age? The second one has almost ten years longer to live. 


---

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(0,1.5,0,0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0,100),

     axes = FALSE, bty = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

text(-5, 5.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,5, 40, 6, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 5.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,5, 84.7, 6, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 5.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
text(-5, 4.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,4, 40, 5, col = "cadetblue")

rect(40,4, 94.4, 5, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 4.5, "remaining life expectancy: 54.4")

arrows(10, 3.8, 40, 3.8, length = .15, lwd = 3, col = "red")

text(-5, 2.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)

text(25, 2.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,2, 84.7, 3, col = "darkgoldenrod2")
text(60, 2.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")

```
???

3. Now let's look at the same woman in 1952 again. She has 44.7 years to live. Now starting from the other end: who has the same remaining life expectancy in 2005? 


---

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(0,1.5,0,0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0,100),
     ylim = c(0,7), type = "n", 
     axes = FALSE, bty = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

text(-5, 5.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,5, 40, 6, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 5.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,5, 84.7, 6, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 5.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
text(-5, 4.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,4, 40, 5, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 4.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,4, 94.4, 5, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 4.5, "remaining life expectancy: 54.4")

arrows(10, 3.8, 40, 3.8, length = .15, lwd = 3, col = "red")

text(-5, 2.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,2, 40, 3, col = "cornsilk3")
text(25, 2.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,2, 84.7, 3, col = "darkgoldenrod2")
text(60, 2.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")

text(-5, 1.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(40,1, 84.7, 2, col = "darkgoldenrod2")
text(60, 1.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
rect(0, 1, 40, 2, col = "cornsilk3")
text(20, 1.5, "40 years lived")

```
???

4. It turns out that in 2005, French women with 44.7 years left to live, were exactly 40 years old. 

So looking this end, the 30-year old and the 40-year old have the same remaining life expectancy, so the prospective age of the 40-year old in 2005 is actually 30 if we use 1952 as the reference year.

---

# Retrospective vs Prospective Age

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height=4, dev='svg'}
par(mar = c(0,1.5,0,0))
plot(1, xlim = c(0,100),
     ylim = c(0,7), type = "n", 
     axes = FALSE, bty = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "")

text(-5, 5.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,5, 40, 6, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 5.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,5, 84.7, 6, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 5.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
text(-5, 4.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,4, 40, 5, col = "cadetblue")
text(25, 4.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,4, 94.4, 5, col = "cornsilk3")
text(60, 4.5, "remaining life expectancy: 54.4")

arrows(10, 3.8, 40, 3.8, length = .15, lwd = 3, col = "red")

text(-5, 2.5, "1952", xpd = TRUE)
rect(10,2, 40, 3, col = "cornsilk3")
text(25, 2.5, "30 years lived")
rect(40,2, 84.7, 3, col = "darkgoldenrod2")
text(60, 2.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")

text(-5, 1.5, "2005", xpd = TRUE)
rect(40,1, 84.7, 2, col = "darkgoldenrod2")
text(60, 1.5, "remaining life expectancy: 44.7")
rect(0, 1, 40, 2, col = "cornsilk3")
text(20, 1.5, "40 years lived")

arrows(84.7, 0.8, 40, 0.8, length = .15, lwd = 3, col = "red")
```
???

So looking from this end, the 30-year old and the 40-year old have the same remaining life expectancy. So they have the same prospective age. 

Which is another way of saying that the prospective age of the 40-year old in 2005 is actually 30 if we use 1952 as the reference year. 

Or rather 40 is the new 30.

# Inflation analogy

???
Perhaps a more intuitive way of thinking about this is using the inflation analogy. This is a common way for economists to think, so let's see if that intuition cannot work for demographers as well. 

Here are some actual data that I stole from the Sanderson and Scherbov example: 

So ignoring inflation US GDP went from 400 billion to 12 trillion. But taking inflation into account the increase is much lower. we are taking into account that a $ can buy a lot less today than it could in 1952, and adjusting the measure to make sure we're not over estimating how rich the US is today. 

Similarly if we look at chronological  median age - the age where half the US population is under and half over that age -- has gone up from 30.2 to 36.1, almost six years. 

But if we use prospective age, we need to first pick a standard reference point, just like we took 2000 dollars, we here use the  2000 life table, and now the prospective median age has actually declined a little bit.

This means that people at the median age in 2005 had a longer remaining life expectancy than people at the median age in 1952. 

SO the 36.1 year old has longer to live than the 30.2 year old did in 1952, that's why their prospective age is lower. 
--
 | 1952          | 2005
------------- | -------------|------------------
US GDP - current dollars (billions)  |    415  |   12,421
US GDP - 2000 dollars (billions) |     2,213  |   10,989
US median age - current chronological age  |    30.2 |   36.1
US median age - prospective age based on 2000 life table |     36.3 |   35.5

# Defining old age

    
???
OK, so now that we understand the concept of prospective age, let's get back to ageing. We started out with three  measures: median age, proportion over 65 and dependency ratio. Now I'm not going to talk about the median age here, because in order to calculate the prospective median age of a population you always have to compare it to a standard population at a certain point in time, which is a bit annoying. 

So we're left with proportion old and the old-age dependency ratio. So how do we use these?

Well, we have to define what old is, and we can do this two ways:  using a fixed age threshold, this is the chronological, retrospective way of looking at age. And there are various thresholds that have been set. 

Althernatively, we could define old age as the age at which we only have a certain number of years left to live. It seems the 15 years left to live is currently a reasonable value, and it's what I will be using here. 

Not necessarily the best way: we could look at a host of physical, environmental, psychological and other factors, but we just don't have enough information to do sth like this. 

This has the advantage of simplicity and data availability
--

* fixed age threshold: 

    + UK - Friendly Societies Act (1875): "any age after 50"

    + Bismarck (1899) *Old Age Insurance Law* for which workers were eligible at age 71

    + American Social Security Act of 1935: age 65

--

* remaining life expectancy threshold:

    + Ryder (1975): *index of old age* 10 years left

    + Siegel (1993): 10 or 15 years left
    
    + Sanderson and Scherbov (2008): 15 years left - $RLE_{15}$ 
    

---

# Prospective ageing in specially selected countries 1980-2050
???
OK, so now we are ready to bring it home. 

So, we've got a concept that allows us to compare ages prospectively, taking into acount changes in life expectancy. 

This means we can compare both countries over time and countries among themselves. 

And we can compare how prospective measures of ageing compare to standard, chronological measures of age. 

So here's what we'll do: for each country we'll first have a look at the old age threshold

--

* Old age threshold: 15 years remaining life expectancy - $RLE_{15}$

--

* Population pyramid with $RLE_{15}$

--

* Proportion of the population over 65 vs proportion over $RLE_{15}$
